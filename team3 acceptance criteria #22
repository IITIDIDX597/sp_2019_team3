Given that I'm a registered rescurer in GHRN and I recieve a request for assistance and it's approaching my set schedule limits
When I choose to cancel the incoming request
Then the system confirms my choice to cancel and then re-routes the drivers request to another rescurer in the area to service them.

Version 2
Given that a rescuer receives a request for assistance and it's approaching set schedule availability limits
When they choose to cancel the incoming request
Then the system confirms the decision and re-routes the drivers request to another rescurer in the area to service them.

(If GHRN is intelligent, it would not route a request to a driver who is nearing a shift - right? It is still an edge case worth having however).
