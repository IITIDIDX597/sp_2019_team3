I'm a driver in need of service and I need to be able to provide the details of my issue so that the GHRN can provide the best rescuer suited to my assistance needs.

Given that I'm a driver with a car in need of service off the side of the road and have registered with GHRN
When I tap to "request service"
Then the system asks me what issues I'm having with my vehicle and i can click from 3 options "Engine issues" "Car body issues" "Gas".
