Given that I'm a registerd rescurer for GHRN(Good Hands Rescue Network) and I am on the road driving to someone who has requested assitance.
When I click on map within the GHRN 
Then the system will list current traffic congestion or/or construction in the area as well as estimated arrival time in minutes, at the most hours, due to amount of the traffic or constrution on the route to the driver.
