Given that I'm a registerd rescurer for GHRN(Good Hands Rescue Network) and I am on the road driving to someone who has requested assistance
When I enter the location at which the driver is currently waiting
Then the system shows me the route that will require least amount of time to reach the driver based on current traffic congestion and/or construction in the area.
