As a rescuer, I want to have a report to refer to every week so that I can improve my time management and assist more drivers.


Given that im a registered rescurer in the GHRN and that I've worked at least a week of assisting drivers
When I select to review my "current weekly report"
Then the system pulls up my report and lists details about how many drivers i have assisted, how many hours i am working, how my ratings are all in a selected seven days range. The default is the most recent 7 day period.
